Introduction to Git
===================

Git is version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
Git works by making a clone of the repository from at server, whenever making changes to your local copy git records and keeps track of the changes. Once the work is done locally you 'push' the changes to the server.

Workflow using git
------------------

Git supports the use of branches, when creating a new git repository a 'master' branch is also created for you. Branching is used to develop different features on the same project without interrupting or disturbing the other features while developing or testing.

Lets say Bob is to develop feature A, so he creates branch named featureA, he can then modify the project in branch featureA without ruining the master branch. Bob finishes his feature and no more bugs present, now he would like to share his work with the others and get his feature implemented into the master branch, this is called merging.

To see the current branch use

::

   git branch

This will show all the branches in your local git repo, and highlight the current branch.

To create a new branch call git branch again with the name appended.


::

   git branch <name>

where <name> is the name of the branch to be created.


To switch to another branch use the git command checkout

::

   git checkout <name>
