* FOSSology
** Installation

   Easy to setup in docker for single use, or can be linked to a database outside docker
Run docker run -p 8081:80 fossology/fossology

Upload source code to fossology and the scans begin to find the licenses. Need to adress them one by one or by bulk.
Still need to look through it, not 100% automatic

** Issues
   Uploaded local github repo of Apex-Go. Included python venv
   This is the tools used locally to deploy Go, but not what is currently on the VM

#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp
