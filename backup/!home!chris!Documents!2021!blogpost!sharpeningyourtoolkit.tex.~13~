\maketitle
In a world that is constantly changing, in a world where you have to keep up with your ever changing surroundings. The task of keeping yourself relevant is not an easy one, it's actually enormously tough! Jobs requiring four years of experience in a JavaScript library that was released only a year ago, for an entry level job.
If you are not always knowledgeable in the current tools being developed and used in corporations around the globe you will fall behind your peers, this is just the world we live in in 2018. \\\\
That is why i use a tool first released in 1975 and it hasnt changed all that much since then, how can a tool that is \textbf{43}! years old still be used, and increase productivity in a busy day to day workflow?
I'll tell you, EMACS as it's called is a text editor used for programming, but it's so much more. Use it for notetaking, use it for to-do lists, use it as a calendar, use it for mails, use it for calculations. Yes, EMACS does all these things and more, EMACS when wielded correctly will turn into your greatest companion. \\\\

"EMACS isn't a text editor, it's a place you go"\\
